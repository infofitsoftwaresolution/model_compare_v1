His speech was clear, coherent, and of normal rate and volume and his thought processes were linear and logical. John explained that \"was doing fine\" until yesterday (9/28) when he started \"digging up stuff from my past.\" He described missing his mom, whom he was the caretaker for until she passed away.

John described having little to no appetite and that he has only been having water and protein shakes for the past 4 weeks. He added that the past two times he's tried to eat solid food, he has gotten sick. John endorsed sleeping 6 - 8 hours a night and taking naps during the day.

MCOT checked in at the front desk and met with John in his room for the duration of the assessment. John was sitting on his bed watching TV when MCOT arrived and appeared well groomed, dressed in casual clothes. John's mood was low and his affect was congruent; however, he was able to smile and laugh appropriately at time. His speech was clear, coherent, and of normal rate and volume and his thought processes were linear and logical. John explained that \"was doing fine\" until yesterday (9/28) when he started \"digging up stuff from my past.\" He described missing his mom, whom he was the caretaker for until she passed away. John denied current SI, HI, AVH, and SUD. He disclosed that he has a history of SIB and pointed to long scars on his forearms where he had engaged in cutting, but stated that the last time he self-harmed was 15 years ago. John described having little to no appetite and that he has only been having water and protein shakes for the past 4 weeks. He added that the past two times he's tried to eat solid food, he has gotten sick. John endorsed sleeping 6 - 8 hours a night and taking naps during the day. When asked about current abuse or neglect, John said he liked the facility he was in but disclosed enduring neglectful treatment at San Gabriel Rehabilitation and Care Center in the past, stating, \"they treated me terribly\". John also disclosed that he has childhood trauma and was molested as a child. John explained that his current coping skills include going on walks and doing push-ups and sit-ups but that he would like to get a therapist and receive mental health counseling. John endorsed having people to talk to, including the staff at his current nursing facility. John does not have transportation and is unsure of his current discharge date. MCOT provided information about IC and the services offered, including housing and case management, as well as a business card with IC's hotline information. John expressed confidence in his ability to contact emergency services as needed. MCOT will follow up to ensure safety and connection to resources. \n\n \n\n  Clinical Quality Indicator\n\n   S1   Not Applicable   \n\n \n\n \n\n  Form\n\n Crisis Services (1240) Progress Note\n\n The Crisis Constituted a Situation in Which (Select all that Apply): The individual believes that he or she presents an immediate danger to self or others or that his or her mental or physical health is at risk or serious deterioration\n\n Risk of Harm: Risk of Harm: Low\r\nRisk Factors: childhood trauma, not connected to a counselor, mother's death\r\nProtective Factors: optimism, resilience, desire to receive therapeutic support\n\n Medical/ Trauma/ Substance Use : John is currently in a nursing and rehabilitation center.\n\n Intervention provided in response to the crisis (Select All That Apply): Problem Solving\n\n Other Relevant Problems/Info: John receives SSDI benefits.

MCOT checked in at the front desk and met with John in his room for the duration of the assessment. John was sitting on his bed watching TV when MCOT arrived and appeared well groomed, dressed in casual clothes. John's mood was low and his affect was congruent; however, he was able to smile and laugh appropriately at time. His speech was clear, coherent, and of normal rate and volume and his thought processes were linear and logical. John explained that \"was doing fine\" until yesterday (9/28) when he started \"digging up stuff from my past.\" He described missing his mom, whom he was the caretaker for until she passed away. John denied current SI, HI, AVH, and SUD. He disclosed that he has a history of SIB and pointed to long scars on his forearms where he had engaged in cutting, but stated that the last time he self-harmed was 15 years ago. John described having little to no appetite and that he has only been having water and protein shakes for the past 4 weeks. He added that the past two times he's tried to eat solid food, he has gotten sick. John endorsed sleeping 6 - 8 hours a night and taking naps during the day. When asked about current abuse or neglect, John said he liked the facility he was in but disclosed enduring neglectful treatment at San Gabriel Rehabilitation and Care Center in the past, stating, \"they treated me terribly\". John also disclosed that he has childhood trauma and was molested as a child. John explained that his current coping skills include going on walks and doing push-ups and sit-ups but that he would like to get a therapist and receive mental health counseling. John endorsed having people to talk to, including the staff at his current nursing facility. John does not have transportation and is unsure of his current discharge date. MCOT provided information about IC and the services offered, including housing and case management, as well as a business card with IC's hotline information.
