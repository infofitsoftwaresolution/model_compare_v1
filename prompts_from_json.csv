SITUATION: Lora had a follow up appt with Dr. Tag on this date as she had broken her L upper arm several weeks ago.
INTERVENTION: Writer escorted Lora from the day program to KC Ortho Clinic for her 1:20 appt. On the way, we discussed how well Lora has been doing and how this appt should be quite easy. Writer and Lora then arrived the clinic and writer assisted Lora with signing in and filling out the required paperwork. Writer and Lora then waited until her name was called which it eventually was. Lora met with the nurse and then she was escorted to get an Xray of her arm. Dr. Tag's PA then met with us and stated that she is ""doing great"" and she should keep up her physical therapy (which she does at the day program). Writer and Lora then made another follow up appt for 6 weeks and then departed. Writer escorted Lora home and then departed. 
RESPONSE: Lora was in a good mood and stated that she is glad that she does not have to wear her sling any longer and she can do more physical exercises. Lora was happy that her arm is healing like it should and she had no other concerns on this date. Lora was very appreciative for the assistance on this day.

 MCOT arrived at Pflugerville Nursing and Rehabilitation Center to meet with John following a routine dispatch from hotline.

John was sitting on his bed watching TV when MCOT arrived and appeared well groomed, dressed in casual clothes. John's mood was low and his affect was congruent; however, he was able to smile and laugh appropriately at time. His speech was clear, coherent, and of normal rate and volume and his thought processes were linear and logical. John explained that ""was doing fine"" until yesterday (9/28) when he started ""digging up stuff from my past."" He described missing his mom, whom he was the caretaker for until she passed away. John denied current SI, HI, AVH, and SUD. He disclosed that he has a history of SIB and pointed to long scars on his forearms where he had engaged in cutting, but stated that the last time he self-harmed was 15 years ago. John described having little to no appetite and that he has only been having water and protein shakes for the past 4 weeks. He added that the past two times he's tried to eat solid food, he has gotten sick. John endorsed sleeping 6 - 8 hours a night and taking naps during the day. When asked about current abuse or neglect, John said he liked the facility he was in but disclosed enduring neglectful treatment at San Gabriel Rehabilitation and Care Center in the past, stating, ""they treated me terribly"". John also disclosed that he has childhood trauma and was molested as a child. John explained that his current coping skills include going on walks and doing push-ups and sit-ups but that he would like to get a therapist and receive mental health counseling. John endorsed having people to talk to, including the staff at his current nursing facility. John does not have transportation and is unsure of his current discharge date. MCOT provided information about IC and the services offered, including housing and case management, as well as a business card with IC's hotline information.

 Crisis Services (1240) Progress Note

  Narrative

 MCOT arrived at Pflugerville Nursing and Rehabilitation Center to meet with John following a routine dispatch from hotline. MCOT checked in at the front desk and met with John in his room for the duration of the assessment. John was sitting on his bed watching TV when MCOT arrived and appeared well groomed, dressed in casual clothes. John's mood was low and his affect was congruent; however, he was able to smile and laugh appropriately at time. His speech was clear, coherent, and of normal rate and volume and his thought processes were linear and logical. John explained that ""was doing fine"" until yesterday (9/28) when he started ""digging up stuff from my past."" He described missing his mom, whom he was the caretaker for until she passed away. John denied current SI, HI, AVH, and SUD. He disclosed that he has a history of SIB and pointed to long scars on his forearms where he had engaged in cutting, but stated that the last time he self-harmed was 15 years ago. John described having little to no appetite and that he has only been having water and protein shakes for the past 4 weeks. He added that the past two times he's tried to eat solid food, he has gotten sick. John endorsed sleeping 6 - 8 hours a night and taking naps during the day. When asked about current abuse or neglect, John said he liked the facility he was in but disclosed enduring neglectful treatment at San Gabriel Rehabilitation and Care Center in the past, stating, ""they treated me terribly"". John also disclosed that he has childhood trauma and was molested as a child. John explained that his current coping skills include going on walks and doing push-ups and sit-ups but that he would like to get a therapist and receive mental health counseling. John endorsed having people to talk to, including the staff at his current nursing facility. John does not have transportation and is unsure of his current discharge date. MCOT provided information about IC and the services offered, including housing and case management, as well as a business card with IC's hotline information. John expressed confidence in his ability to contact emergency services as needed. MCOT will follow up to ensure safety and connection to resources.
